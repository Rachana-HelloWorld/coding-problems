// Given a matrix with rows as Ingredients I1,I2...In, and columns as Protiens, carbs and Fat
// Prepare a diet plan for the given test input {5,7,12} where first index element indicates the number of 
// protiens to be included in the diet, 2nd index indicates number of carbs to be included in the diet and 3rd index
// indicate no of fats 
// For eg: int[][] m = { 
//						 {2,4,6},
//						 {3,1,9},
//						 {1,0,8},
//					     {2,6,3}
//					    }
// Test input = {5,7,12}
// Output should be {2,4} as row 2 and row 4 are the ingredients which will give the exact required amount of protiens, 
// fats and carbs. If no ingredients give the specified amount of P,C,F then return 0.
// If more than one combination of ingredients satisfy the condition, return that combination which has fewer ingredients
